# Vulnerabilities-in-Communication-Security - CSC 321 <br>

Part 1: Simple implementation of message transfer with symmetric key encryption/decryption and SHA256. <br>

Part 2: Similar messaging scheme to Part 1, with a man-in-the-middle attack included. <br>

Part 3: A showcase of public key (asymmetric key) AES encryption being able to prevent communication eavesdroppers from easily decrypting messages.
